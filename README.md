## 👋🏻 Hello im Christian ! 

###  😁 About Me

I am a full-stack software engineer based in Phoenix, AZ currently interning at Scientist.com. I began my journey in software development through a rigorous bootcamp called LEARN Academy Additionally, I am proud to have served in the US Army as a veteran.

My experience in the classroom taught me the importance of adaptability and problem-solving, skills that have made me an effective communicator in my work as a developer. I am passionate about using my expertise to create innovative solutions and always seek to challenge myself to grow as a professional.

My education has allowed me to work on a variety of projects, both front-end and back-end, making me a polyglot with proficiency in various programming languages. I am eager to continue my journey as a growing developer, tackling blockers one day at a time.

In summary, I am a motivated and skilled software engineer with a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence. I thrive on solving complex problems and am always eager to expand my knowledge and skillset in the ever-evolving world of technology. My experience in the US Army has taught me valuable skills such as discipline, teamwork, and leadership, which I bring to my work as a software engineer.

🎉 Outside of work, I enjoy playing competive online games like CSGO & Dota and outside the computer I enjoy hiking & bodybuilding.
