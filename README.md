## 👋🏻 Hello im Christian ! 

###  😁 About Me

I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Phoenix, AZ, currently interning at Scientist.com. I began my journey in software development through LEARN Academy, a rigorous bootcamp that taught me the importance of adaptability and problem-solving, making me an effective communicator in my work.

My passion for using technology to create innovative solutions drives me to continuously challenge myself and grow as a professional. I have gained a diverse set of skills and experience in both front-end and back-end development, making me proficient in various programming languages.

🛠 I approach challenges with determination and perseverance, working through blockers one day at a time until I achieve my goals.

As a veteran of the US Army, I have developed valuable skills such as discipline, teamwork, and leadership, which I apply to my work as a software engineer.

👾 Outside of work, I enjoy participating in competitive online games such as CSGO and Dota, as well as activities such as hiking and bodybuilding.

In summary, I am a motivated and skilled software engineer with a passion for innovation and excellence. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skillset and use my expertise to create impactful solutions.
